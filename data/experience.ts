        jobDescription: `
       At Dell Technologies, I contributed to modernizing legacy customer and internal portals used by 30 K + users monthly.
I rebuilt front-end modules with React + TypeScript + Material UI, unifying the design across five platforms and improving load time by 2.5 seconds through SQL query tuning and API optimization.
I developed over 20 Spring Boot REST APIs backed by SQL Server, integrated Node.js middleware, and containerized deployments using Azure DevOps, Docker, and Kubernetes — reducing manual setup time per sprint.
Additionally, I diagnosed production issues using Dynatrace and Splunk, cutting recurring incidents by 40%.
This experience taught me how to build reliable, high-performance systems at enterprise scale.`,

        jobDescription: `
        At Uber, I helped scale the ride-matching and surge-pricing systems that process over a million daily API requests across major cities.
Using Node.js, React, and microservices, I developed services to optimize driver-rider pairing and integrated Deep ETA ML models to improve time-to-pickup accuracy. I built a React-based admin console to monitor demand surges and trigger pricing overrides in real time.
Our services ran in Docker containers on Kubernetes, supported by automated CI/CD pipelines.
This work improved ride allocation efficiency, enhanced pricing accuracy, and made the system more resilient during high-demand spikes.

        startDate: "2025-02",
        jobDescription: `At J.P.Morgan Chase, I engineered Java-based Spring Boot microservices to streamline artifact ownership and compliance across 12 enterprise applications. I integrated Apache Kafka for asynchronous workflows, eliminating manual ownership updates per release and improving traceability for audit teams.
I also implemented secure REST APIs with JWT + Spring Security, enabling data sharing across governance platforms and reducing deployment time from days to hours through Jenkins CI/CD. On the UI side, I built React + TypeScript components using Salt-DS to standardize dashboards and added automated testing with Jest to prevent regressions.
This project strengthened system reliability, cut manual dependencies, and made compliance workflows fully auditable.`,
